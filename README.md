# Skeleton for a simple password encoding and decoding program with a menu interface

The program displays a menu that lets users choose to encode a password by shifting each digit by 3 (modulo 10), decode a password (though the decoding function is not implemented), or quit the program. It also tracks how many times the encoding and decoding options are used but does not handle variable initialization properly.
